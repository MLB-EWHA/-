# MLB_EWHA Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the implementation of the **Machine Learning** course project. The project explores **Closed-world** and **Open-world** classification tasks using datasets of monitored and unmonitored websites.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`Datasets/`**: Contains the processed datasets:
  - `mon.csv`: Features extracted from the `mon_standard.pkl` file.
  - `unmon.csv`: Features extracted from the `unmon_standard10.pkl` file.

- **`Task Process/`**: Includes all the code used during project development.

- **`Optimized Models/`**: Contains optimized code for evaluation purposes.

- **`load_pickle_code.ipynb`**: Sample code for feature extraction and conversion of `.pkl` files to arrays.

## üìä Project Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Closed-World Classification
- **Objective**: Classify 95 monitored websites into 95 unique labels.
- **Dataset**: `mon.csv` (processed from `mon_standard.pkl`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open-World Classification
- **Objective**: Include both monitored and unmonitored datasets for the following tasks:
  - **Binary Classification**: Predict whether a trace is monitored (`1`) or unmonitored (`-1`).
  - **Multi-Class Classification**: Classify 95 monitored websites (`0-94`) and unmonitored websites (`-1`) into a total of 96 classes.

| `mon_standard.pkl`    | 19,000    | 95                    | Monitored website traces. Each website has 10 subpages, observed 20 times each.                 |
| `unmon_standard10.pkl`| 3,000     | - (unmonitored only)  | Unmonitored website traces.                                                                     |
